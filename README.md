# #GoGreen: *Team 98*

## Our rules:
* To come into the session past 9 o'clock is to buy everyone a coffee (the second person who comes in late gets everyone a kitkat)
* If you are going to be exceptionally late or not able to come at all, notify us the day before.
* If you are stuck or lacking behind, ask help! That's what a team is for :-)
* Do not ever commit to master. Ever.
* A merge request into the master branch requires 4 approvals, including yourself.
* Nobody leaves before 12 o'clock.
* Be as descriptive as possible both within your code and in your commits.
