## How to play?

In order to play Clima Mutatio Dolus, you need to log your transportation, food, and energy consumption habits on a regular basis.
Each time you make a 'green-friendly' decision, such as getting to your destination using a bicycle instead of a car,
you can log it in your account, and we will estimate the impact of your actions on the environment in terms of emissions.
To make the experience more engaging, we encourage you to add your friends to the game.
This will allow you to compare your results and emissions figures with theirs.
All stats and data from your emission savings can be tracked through the right side panel.
