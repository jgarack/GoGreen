Personal Development Plan, Vidas Bacevicius, NetID:4913175

For this project, I ultimately want to learn how to use Git, see how a proper programming project is made as well as see how my own strengths can be used in a big group project like this. I think it will be important for all of us, since I'm assuming most of us are planning to be software engineers.

My strong points would be willingness to communicate and help others. I always strive to help anyone who needs/asks for my help.

My weak points include lack of planning practice and keeping up with predetermined deadlines, but I sure as hell don't plan on letting down my teammates and will work as hard as possible to keep up with everything.

During this project, I strive to improve my communication and teamwork skills, as well as, obviously, my programming (googling!!) skills. Lastly, I think that this project will be a great way of networking, which is also very important for a programmer or a software developer to have.

All in all, I'm sure this will be a very interesting and engaging project I am looking forward to.
