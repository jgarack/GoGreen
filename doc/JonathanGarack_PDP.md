One of my strong points is not giving up if something does not go my way, I always try to find a way to achieve the goal.
My weak points are punctuality, and my english (so please don’t laugh about my grammar).


My main goal during this project is to learn how to work in a group, as well as learning how to create such an app from the scratch. I had some experience while creating some simple websites, but always after few weeks of work everything ended up disorganised. As I said I never tried to create something more ambitious than a website, so it is a good opportunity to create something interesting. 

I hope my goals can be easily achieved and we are going to have a good time getting these 10.
