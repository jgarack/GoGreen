Alexander: maven and git are delaying us, but it can be solved with time. Next week we should decide what to do with the client. Connect the db with the server and implement features. It is better to meet to get stuff done. 

Vidas: whilst he was figuring out how it all works (git, maven, etc), team mates finished work. Hopes to contribute more in the upcoming weeks. 

Omar: is happy with the communication, albeit issues popping up (git and maven). Wants to catch up with coding for next week.

Lesichkov: no issues till friday. Merge spring with javafx was an issue. Next week next landing page on the app. 

Alvaro: done with schema on first day. Not much done through in terms of coding throughout the week, but has been informing himself on stuff we will need with upcoming features on the app. Next week, tba. 

Jonathan: db made. Debugging was difficult, as it was made together with other teammates. Gitlab was a pain. 

Bejruz: couldn't get much done this week due to workload not being fully defined and the assignment being done sooner than expected. Will look into splitting the workload in a much more precise manner to avoid this in the future.
