- Core Quality [Puctual and Organized] => Pitfall [Has a hard time dealing with unorganized people] => Challenge [Learn to cope with diffent types of work ethics] => Allergy [Become unorganized myself]

- Core Quality [Great at getting stuff done on my own] => Pitfall [Requieres more effort to coordinate with others] => Challenge [Learn the word dynamics when working on a project in a relatively large group] => Allergy [Become too dependent on others to get work done]

~ Example of core quality: I took a gap year through 2017/2018, during which I worked in an office and wasnt late a singe day in almost a year. This can be seen in a team working environment through consistency in our meetings and in our self set deadlines.

~ Example of pitfalls: I've always held an unfavourable opinion towards (very) unpunctual/unorganized people, specially in a work-like environment. This would be displayed if someone missed a deadline that would affect the entire team without any previous indication.


GOAL: My objective for this project is to learn to procrastinate as little as possible. I will consider this goal achieved once we have successfully submitted this project and I have not missed a single self-set or university-set deadline throughout the project. To know when to and how to avoid procrastinating is an important skill to have in a professional environment, which is why I will strive to acquire it during this project.

REALITY: I currently fall victim to procrastination on an almost daily basis, though I have been working on methods to avoid it with relative success. However, it can still use lots of work and I will use this projects to get over this issue.

OPTIONS: The most obvious option would be a combination of consistent work and communication. I emphasize the use of "consisten work", and not "hard work". The biggest obstacle that could prevent me personally from achieving this goal would be procrastination.

WILL: I will strive to get work done on a weekly basis not to let it pile on, which I have learned to be of utmost importance. What I can do right now to move towards this goal is to follow the saying "why leave for tomorrow what you can do today". Teamwork is essential in a project of this nature, given how everyone will only do 1/7th of the work, meaining that individually done work is not as relevant as the combination of it all, making communication and cooperation the real priority in this.
