I was responsible for the delivery of the GUI part of the application. Having made several front-end applications before, i was confident that i would best fit in a team, where I design the application. I had no previous experience with Java GUI libraries and frameworks, but that was not a setback at the time. 

After the team distributed the work among the members, I was eager to find out how this project is going to work out, because as I stated in my PDP, my strongest motivation was to find out how real applications with a team are built. First weeks were the hardest, because everything that I was supposed to use was new to me. Thus, in spite of having been ahead of schedule in week 1, I was late in weeks 2 and 3.  After that, I picked up my pace and managed to always stay ahead of schedule and, if possible, implement extra features.  

My strongest point during this point was the dedication towards the project. I stumbled upon many problems, but my motivation to add more features to the application i am building drove me forward. As a weaker point, I would single out the bad planning that i did for weeks 2 and 3, where i was behind schedule. At that point, i had not realized that the most work to be done is at the start. After that was easy.       

Concerning my team, I am of the opinion that we managed to sync very well. We all worked very well together and everyone managed to keep up with the established pace. Whenever one had problem with something, others tried and helped him. The only conflict that we had was in the middle of the project and it was about the bad planning and the division of the work. However, we solved it in no time and were on track again.
