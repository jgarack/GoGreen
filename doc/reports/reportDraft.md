2.Design decisions: 

One of the major decisions that we made as a team, was that at the start of the group project, we split the work on the application into groups. We decided that Omar, Alex and Vidas will be working on the server-side, Alvaro and Jonathan – on the databases, and Lachezar and Berry will design the GUI.... 

Concerning the technological choices that the team made, firstly, we researched the frameworks and libraries that we were going to need to build the application. The team then decided to build the server using the Spring boot framework(//TO_ALEX: add why?) and to make the data retrievals using the ORM framework - Hibernate. Concerning the GUI, we chose JavaFX, because it is easier to implement than Swing and AWT. Furthermore, more than 70 libraries are implemented for JavaFX and thus, it was going to be much easier to design the application. The images were created on Adobe Illustrator, because we decided that we are going to have an unique interface of the application.  

3.Points for improvement: 

There is much space for improvement in the software that we designed. For example, the GUI can be made even more advanced, e.g. background animations can be added to the main screen and the quality of the front-end code can be improved. Furthermore, the GUI itself can be tested using TestFX (JavaFX test framework). 

As a whole, the making of the project itself could have been improved by the team members. Although the team synced well, the planning did not go as expected and we had to create a new thoroughly thought plan in the middle of the timespan of the project.


4.Individual feedback

Lachezar Lesichkov 
 

I was responsible for the delivery of the GUI part of the application. Having made several front-end applications before, i was confident that i would best fit in a team, where I design the application. I had no previous experience with Java GUI libraries and frameworks, but that was not a setback at the time. 

After the team distributed the work among the members, I was eager to find out how this project is going to work out, because as I stated in my PDP, my strongest motivation was to find out how real applications with a team are built. First weeks were the hardest, because everything that I was supposed to use was new to me. Thus, in spite of having been ahead of schedule in week 1, I was late in weeks 2 and 3.  After that, I picked up my pace and managed to always stay ahead of schedule and, if possible, implement extra features.  

My strongest point during this point was the dedication towards the project. I stumbled upon many problems, but my motivation to add more features to the application i am building drove me forward. As a weaker point, I would single out the bad planning that i did for weeks 2 and 3, where i was behind schedule. At that point, i had not realized that the most work to be done is at the start. After that was easy.       

Concerning my team, I am of the opinion that we managed to sync very well. We all worked very well together and everyone managed to keep up with the established pace. Whenever one had problem with something, others tried and helped him. The only conflict that we had was in the middle of the project and it was about the bad planning and the division of the work. However, we solved it in no time and were on track again.

During the OOP project I was part of the duo in charge of the GUI, together with Lachezar. My work consisted mostly of graphics, styling, and layout. The team functioned surprisingly well, given how all the members were selected randomly. I found that most of the group members were more ambitious with the final grade than I was, but this did not stop me from contributing to the group whenever possible and whenever requested.

Admittedly, my performance during the first two weeks was lackluster. Nevertheless, I picked up my pace shortly after and found the set of skills I could bring to the table that would uniquely contribute towards the final product and the project as a whole. A factor that added towards my less than ideal start was the lack of clear delineation of work, which when brought up to our attention, we resolved swiftly. 

Much to my surprise, aside from the work delineation mishap at the start, which was resolved with more abundant and clearer communication, there were no other notable conflict between the team members. The greatest testament to how our group functioned like a well-oiled machine and with an uncanny lack of conflict is that we finished the app two weeks in advance of the deadline, which allowed us to further work on extra features and polish out the existing ones. 

In conclusion, my greatest shortcoming during the project was, in my opinion, my lack of ambition at the start, where as I consider my strong point to be my decent communication skills and creativity.
