## Personal development plan | √Ålvaro Buj



### STRONG points:


#### Friendly

I usually get along with the people I hang out with and try to avoid conflicts, I perform much better in a team environment where we all enjoy working together.
- **Example:** in the last years of High School my friends and I studied together most evenings and our grades improved significantly and we bonded a lot and in the end all of us managed to get into the Bachelors we wanted which is very hard in Spain.
- **In a team** this is shown by allowing the members to know each other better and not being afraid to ask or offer help to those who are struggling in an specific part of the project.
- **Pitfall:** focusing more in having banter and procrastinating than in the actual work.
- **Challenge:** achieve a team environment where we are all comfortable and help each other.
- **Allergy:** working on a toxic team environment.

#### Curious

I really enjoy looking up information for different subjects, I can just start browsing Wikipedia for the most trivial thing and end up watching hour long documentaries about that subject.
- **Example:** Once, in High School I forgot we had an oral presentation scheduled for that day and when my turn came to speak I just talked for 20 minutes about Syndrome K which is a fake disease someone invented in WWII to save Jew population from Nazi concentration camps that I had watched a documentary about the previous night.
- **In a team** this is could be shown when we need information from a specific library, software, etc.
- **Pitfall:** when the "looking up stuff" becomes just procrastinating.
- **Challenge:** having all the necessary information to make the most optimal project.
- **Allergy:** making choices without evaluating the different options enough.



### WEAK points:

#### Easily distracted

I just forget I'm doing stuff
- **Example:** when I was in Primary School I forgot to take out my pyjamas' pants 5 times in the same year, I went to school wearing them under my actual pants.
- **In a team** this could be a problem if I forget to do a task I'm assigned to.

#### Not a morning person

I perform much better later in the day
- **Example:** I've fallen asleep a few times in the first period in High School.
- **In a team** this will be shown during the first hour of our Monday meetings when I look as if I hadn't sleep in days.



### GOAL:

My goal in this course is to both learn how to work in an environment similar to a workplace and to improve my Java skills.

This is important to me because this is the closest course we have to what we might be doing for professional careers and I need to find out if I really like it.

I'll have succeeded in this goal when I have both learnt enough Java that I really feel comfortable with it and I have experienced what I'm hoping to get from a workplace-like environment.



### REALITY:

I'm preparing to face this course by going to sleep early so I can give 100% on the morning meetings and redoing OOP assignments.

It is going well but I hope I'm able to keep up with it.



### OPTIONS:

Making a schedule that I follow seriously and combines lectures, meetings, studying and working hours and free time.

Coding on the side to practice my skills.

Read different documentation that we could use.



### WILL:

Right now I'm working on making my schedule, then I will read about different libraries we could use.

My team could help by reading about libraries as well so we can compare them on our meeting and choose the best one.
