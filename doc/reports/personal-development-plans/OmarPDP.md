Core Quality: Speaker -> Pitfall: Blabber Mouth -> Challenge: Concise speaking -> Allergy: Silence/Not speaking enough

Core Quality: Team Player -> Pitfall: Too dependant on team/work less/procrastinate -> Allergy: work effectively alone and as team member -> Pitfall: Try to do all on my own

Examples of these skills: used to be a student ambassodor for the University Of Sheffield in Egypt where i worked on my public speaking skills.
I Played BasketBall for a long time where I was taught how to be part of a team
and ive worked on several school projects where working as a team was necessary

Examples of pitfalls: when I used to play with my team sometimes I would depend on the team too much and wouldnt put in enough effort, which made us fall behind.
I'd also get too confident sometimes and try to do everything on my own which also lead to a negative outcome.

I tend to speak in very long and descriptive sentences whcih can sometimes be meaningless and annoying. When I realize that is the case I tend to stay silent.

Goal: My goal in this project is to see how the knowledge we have accumlated over the past 2 quarters can be applied by working in a team, and in a real life senario.
Bringing our personal and educational skills togeteher to learn and grow as a team. 
this is important to me as I love learning and seeing other several points of view on the same issue. This helps develop my problem solving skills and accumlate knowledge from my peers.
i feel like this goal is very progressive and may be reached by the end of the project.

Reality: I see that its hard to not work on my goal as my team is very helpful and cooperative as i saw from the first session. I feel like theyre a great group to grow and learn with for this quarter

Options: the only thing that would prevent me from reaching my goal is lack of communication! as long as we communicate we will achieve profound results!

Will: In order to reach this goal i will try to motivate my team and try to have a good peer to peer relationship, by trying to stick to the rules and doing my required tasks.
This assignment is the first concrete step im taking towards the goal. I belive that my team mates can help achieve this goal by having an open mind to possible mistakes made by group members and once again by communicating.
