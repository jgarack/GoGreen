# Create a plan to achieve your goal (GROW)

## Goal
* My goal during this course is to plan the project in a good way.
  * This is important for me, because I have had trouble with this in the past, and because the quality of the work delivered suffers a lot if you have to sprint for a deadline.
  * I will have succeeded in this goal if we manage to clear the deadlines with spare time, and there is no stress for reaching the deadlines.
* My second goal during this course is for us to function well as a team.
  * This is important for me, because tensions within the team will demoralise me. Furthermore, later on in life I will have to work in a team more often, and being able to work efficiently in a team is a quality that is appreciated by future employers.
  * I will consider this goal as a success if we manage to solve conflicts and crisis situations during the project in a civilised way.
## Reality
I'm actively working on getting the project started together,
and i have faith in next meeting, where we will discuss where to start and what steps to take.
I do have a fear that we'll be lacking behind from the beginning,
and I'm aware that I need to stay away from being too much on top of things and teammates.
I do think, however, that if we continue the way things are going now, we will be missing out on deadlines.
## Options
My best option to work on my goals is to take a step forward and encourage the team
to improve our planning, so we can get things done. Also, I plan to employ my strength in
helping others out to help teammates that are lacking behind in keeping up with the deadlines.
I think that we should aim high for the first few weeks, so we have a solid base to build further upon.
## Will
I will be the chair of our first 'organised' meeting, this is an opportunity for me to
set goals for the team, and to make a good outline for the course of the project together.
My teammates can help me by being actively engaged in the steps that we should take now, and
by finishing deadlines together, sooner rather than later.

**action plan:**
* Stay engaged in the team, especially how others are keeping up with the deadlines
and whether they need help, but most importantly, keeping up with the deadlines myself
and asking for help early if necessary.
* Support teammates in completing their tasks themselves when they are in trouble,
rather than just taking over. This is the best way for all of us to learn, and if someone does
not understand something, he may not be able to understand things that build on top of it either.
