Everybody more or less finished their tasks, just some minor issues:

Vidas and Alex:
3 methods left to test, otherwise 100% branch coverage.

Omar:
Working on imgur; didn't work as well as it thought. Everything else went fine.

Lassie:
Made the database side of achievements; Berry made the icons for the achievements.

Alvaro:
Heroku, still have yet to update the database for current week's classes.

John:
DBAdaptor tests, checkstyle. All went well.

Tijmen wants to see his friends' achievements and points when you double click on a friend.

Also, the time and date when the achievement was achieved should be implemented.

Vidas and Alex - testing lmao
Alvaro - server
Berry - gui
Johnathan - db tests/db
Omar - wallpaper/gui/anything else that needs help
